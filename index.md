## Favorite Labs from CPSCL

Lab 4 Part 2

I liked this lab because of the fact we got to make a little game as a part of our lab. Working on if statements was also very fun, I will say this is my favorite topic that I have learned in all of CPSC. It was also fun as I got to work with a friend.

Lab 6 Part 2

This lab was fun because we got to do a little blackjack experiment. I had a bit of trouble at first but together with my lab partner (now friend) we got it done. The trial and error to the straight up re-writing of the code altogether, but it got done

Lab 11 Part 2

This lab was also a game that we got to make. The fun part of this lab was the amount of trial and error I had to go through before I finished. I also became friends with my lab partner where we bonded over stressing out on what we were doing wrong.
